Brent Yorgey explains the motivation and purpose of his Diagrams library and how it relates to other programmatic graphics systems like TikZ. He then shares his motivation for writing the Typeclassopedia and his thoughts on how much category theory Haskell programmers need to know. He also shares some insights from teaching an introductory Haskell course.
