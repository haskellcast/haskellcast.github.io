Austin Seipp joins us to discuss Haskell security and infrastructure. We talk about how Haskell security differs from C (and where it doesn't) and some coming changes to Cabal security. Then we discuss Cryptol: a Haskell-inspired language for implementing cryptographic algorithms in a way that more closely resembles their mathematical specification. Finally, we talk a bit about his work in maintaining the haskell.org infrastructure and his time as a GHC release manager. Along the way, Austin shares about his pet projects, including hardware projects using CλaSH.
