Simon Marlow, author of Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell and co-developer of GHC, lets us know what he's been up to at Facebook. He shares with us the project he's been working on in Facebook and how Haskell is gaining traction inside Facebook's diverse engineering culture. We also talk about his recent book and what he'll be researching in the future.
